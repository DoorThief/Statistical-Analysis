# Statistic-Analysis
Personal project to develop a couple tools for rudamentary statistical analysis.
# Files:
stat.bash   - Calculates mean, sd, se, t or z test via bc pipe (very slow)

stat.py     - Calclulates mean, sd, se, z test (fast!)

write_rand  - Writes random numbers to a file seperated by \n
