# Statistic-Analysis
Personal project to develop a couple tools for rudimentary statistical analysis.
# Files:
stat.bash   - Calculates mean, sd, se, t or z test via bc pipe (very slow)

rand.bash  - Writes random numbers to a file seperated by (slow)

stat.py     - Calclulates mean, sd, se. Can preform Z-Test, T-Test, and 2 Sample Z-Test (--Best tool--)

rand.py     - Writes random numbers to a file seperated by new lines
